# examRank02
This is a repo with all the resources to pass the examRank02 of the 42Cursus.

In the exam you are going to have two exercises. The first one can be, or inter or union and in the second exercise you can have 
GNL or ft_printf.

It includes subjects.

I passed GNL so i'm not 100% sure ft_printf works.
